We have consider several metrics as parameters for evaluating our proposed algorithm. We have set several property for this evaluation from experimental result. As we have worked on data set that comes like stream so we have set parameters for both the frequent item set mining from total data set and per window. The parameters and properties are given below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Tree construction time per window and total database vs minimum support.
\item Mining time per window and total database vs minimum support.
\item Total time to complete per window and total database vs minimum support.
\item Total tree node in tree per window.
\item Total memory needed by mining process
\end{itemize}
